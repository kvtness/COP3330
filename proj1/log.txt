01/27/18 - Wrote code for LexDiff and DictionaryDiff and tested it.

    ./diffcalc.x abc acz

        LexDiff(s1,s2) = -1
        DicDiff(s1,s2) = -1

    ./diffcalc.x abc abz

        LexDiff(s1,s2) = -23
        DicDiff(s1,s2) = -1

    ./diffcalc.x abf abc

        LexDiff(s1,s2) = 3
        DicDiff(s1,s2) = 1

    /diffcalc.x abc abc

        LexDiff(s1,s2) = 0
        DicDiff(s1,s2) = 0

    ./diffcalc.x ab abc

        LexDiff(s1,s2) = -99
        DicDiff(s1,s2) = -1

    ./diffcalc.x abc ab

         LexDiff(s1,s2) = 99
         DicDiff(s1,s2) = 1

    ./diffcalc.x abc abD

         LexDiff(s1,s2) = 31
         DicDiff(s1,s2) = -1

    ./diffcalc.x abc abd

         LexDiff(s1,s2) = -1
         DicDiff(s1,s2) = -1

    ./diffcalc.x aBc abc

         LexDiff(s1,s2) = -32
         DicDiff(s1,s2) = 0

01/27/18 - Wrote code for Sorting and tested it

    ./ssort.x A 3
    ac
    ab
    a

        ** maximum of 3 strings reached - terminating read loop

        3 strings as read:
          ac
          ab
          a

        3 strings after ascii sort:
          a
          ab
          ac


    ./ssort.x A 3
    a
    A
    b

        ** maximum of 3 strings reached - terminating read loop

        3 strings as read:
          a
          A
          b

        3 strings after ascii sort:
          A
          a
          b

    ./ssort.x D 3
